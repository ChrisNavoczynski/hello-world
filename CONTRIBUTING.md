# Welcome!

Welcome to Hello, World! Group 2

## 

Part of the class is to explore different development enviroments. This repository will be for code contributions from all class members. The class is divided into groups.
There is a directory for group. Each student should only contribute code to the directory for his/her group. The GitHub security model allows each contributor access
to the entire repository, but please be responsibe and put your code in your assigned directory!

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.

## Code of Conduct

Please respect Hello, World's purpose and design structure. The design structure is described below. 
Also, the following pages are **NOT** to be added by any contributors:

* index.html
* error.html
* README.md
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* LICENSE
* CONTRIBUTING.md

If you are updating these pages for a class assignment or a group project be sure to commit the pages to
the correct respository! **NOT** the top level repository!

### At the top of the structure will be:

* index.html
* error.html
* README.md
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* LICENSE
* CONTRIBUTING.md

### At the next level will be directories for each group and for the lead author (bob):

* group1
* group2
* group3
* group4
* bob

### Index.html will point to one landing page in each group's directory:

* group1 > hello.html
* group2 > hello.html
* group3 > hello.html
* group4 > hello.html
* bob > hello.html

## if you change your group's landing page, notify the instructor so index.html can updated at the top level!

### Reminders

* Be sure to keep your group's content in its own folder!
* Also be sure to fix any broken links in your group's folder!
* Any stray files or directories left at the top level will be deleted.
