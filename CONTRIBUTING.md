## Code of Conduct

Communicate any updates you contribute to this repository using our Slack channel.

## Files in our Group 2 Repository
* index.html
* error.html
* README.md (Updated Weekly)
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md 
* LICENSE (Created)
* CONTRIBUTING.md (Created)

### At the next level will be directories for each group and for the lead author (bob):
* We use Group 2 folder/files

### Index.html will point to one landing page in each group's directory:
* group2 > hello.html

## if you change your group's landing page, notify the instructor so index.html can updated at the top level!

### Reminders
* Be sure to keep your group's content in its own folder!
* Also be sure to fix any broken links in your group's folder!
* Any stray files or directories left at the top level will be deleted.
